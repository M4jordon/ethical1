##  These Are The WPA-Length Passwords!

  * The lines in this folder are all 8-40 characters long. This is the format used by routers protected by WPA/2 security
  * Their length is in their title.
  * These files were generated by removing entries from the Real-Passwords files that did not fit the length requirements.

Lists sorted by popularity will include `probable-v2` in the filename.

__Note that these files are CUMULATIVE.__ <br>

I.E, the entirety of the smallest file is contained in the 2nd smallest file. All of the smaller files are contained in the largest file.  <br>

However, each unique line appears only once in each file.


### Torrents

* Two styles of compression are available: 7Z, and tar.gz

#### Recommended Torrent Client:
