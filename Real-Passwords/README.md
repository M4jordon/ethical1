# Real-Passwords


##  These Are The Passwords!  


 After amalgamating all the passwords into one file, the file was sorted by popularity. This was possible due to the fact that the number of times each password appeared in all the files would be included on each line of the amalgamation.

The files in this folder were generated by carving out sections of the amalgamation with passwords that appeared more than a certain number of times.
Files are available for 350, 250, 150, 75, 50, 25, 15, 10, and 5 appearances.

| Filename | Appearances|
| ---- | ----|
| `Top207-probable-v2.txt` | lines appeared at least __350__ times |
| `Top1575-probable-v2.txt` | lines appeared at least __250__ times |
| `Top12Thousand-probable-v2.txt` | lines appeared at least __150__ times |
| `Top304Thousand-probable-v2.txt` | lines appearedat least __75__ times |
| `Top1pt6Million-probable-v2.txt` | lines appearedat least __50__ times |
| `Top109Million-probable-v2.txt` | lines appeared at least __15__ times |
| `Top353Million-probable-v2.txt` | lines appeared at least __10__ times |
| `Top2Billion-probable-v2.txt` | lines appeared at least __5__ times |



__Note that these files are CUMULATIVE.__ <br>
*I.E, the entirety of the smallest file is contained in the 2nd smallest file. All of the smaller files are contained in the largest file.*  <br>
This does not mean there are repititions, however.
