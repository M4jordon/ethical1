# Probabable Password Trend Analysis

### In order to get a better idea of the trends of secure and insecure passwords, I ran a portion of these lists through [DigiNinja's Pipal.](https://digi.ninja/projects/pipal.php)

Pipal was run on a list of the __Top 32 Most Popular Passwords__ - not the largest list in the repo, 
but sizable enough to encompass notable trends.

Passwords included in this analysis appeared at least 10 times in the Revision 1 Files.

I've organized the data into charts that easily demonstrate trends.
Each chart also contains insights and actionable conclusions drawn from the data

Enjoy, and be safe!
